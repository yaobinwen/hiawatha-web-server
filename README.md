Hiawatha is an open source webserver with security, easy to use and lightweight as the three key features. It supports among others (Fast)CGI, IPv6, URL rewriting and reverse proxy and has security features no other webserver has, like blocking SQL injections, XSS, CSRF and exploit attempts. Hiawatha runs perfectly on Linux, BSD and MacOS X.

The Hiawatha webserver has been written by Hugo Leisink \<hugo@leisink.net\>. More information about the Hiawatha webserver can be found at https://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/.
